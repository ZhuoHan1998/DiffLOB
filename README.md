### DiffLOB

Diffusion Models for Controllable and Counterfactual Generation in Limit Order Books

This repository contains the official implementation of DiffLOB, a diffusion-based framework for controllable and counterfactual generation of limit order book (LOB) trajectories.

DiffLOB explicitly conditions the generative process on future market regimes—including trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance—enabling direct intervention on hypothetical future conditions and answering counterfactual “what-if” queries without relying on agent-based interaction.
